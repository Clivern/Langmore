## Design of Langmore

`Langmore` uses a lot of principles from log-structured file systems and draws inspiration from a number of designs that involve log file merging. It essentially is just a directory of append-only (log) files with a fixed structure and an in-memory index holding the keys mapped to a bunch of information necessary for point lookups - referring to the entry in the datafile.

### Datafiles

They re append-only log files that hold the KV pairs along with some meta-information. A single `Langmore` instance could have many datafiles, out of which just one will be active and opened for writing, while the others are considered immutable and are only used for reads.

</p>


Each entry in the datafile has a fixed structure illustrated above and it stores `CRC`, `timestamp`, `key_size`, `value_size`, `actual_key`, and the `actual_value`. All the write operations - create, update and delete - made on the engine translates into entries in this active datafile. When this active datafile meets a size threshold, it is closed and a new active datafile is created. when closed (intentionally or unintentionally), the datafile is considered immutable and is never opened for writing again.

### KeyDir

It is an in-memory hash table that stores all the keys present in the Langmore instance and maps it to the offset in the datafile where the log entry (value) resides; thus facilitating the point lookups. The mapped value in the Hash Table is a structure that holds `file_id`, `offset`, and some meta-information like timestamp, as illustrated below.

## Deployment

Build the project with the following command

```bash
$ make build
```

or install with cargo

```bash
$ cargo install langmore
```

Define the configs and run the `Langmore` binary.

```bash
export HOSTNAME=127.0.0.1:8080
export STORAGE_DIR=/etc/langmore

$ ./target/debug/langmore
```


## Usage

You can use `netcat` to interact with `Langmore`

```bash
$ nc 127.0.0.1 8080
```
